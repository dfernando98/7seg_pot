# Control 7 segment display with a potentiometer

This project uses a potentiometer to control a seven segment display. Using an Arduino Uno as the communication interface between the two peripherals, the potentiometer would display a single number from 0-9 on the seven segment display.

## List of components
1. Arduino Uno
2. Rotary potentiometer
3. Seven segment display (5611AS - common cathode)
4. 220 kÎ© resistor
